    "## Using OpenAI API for Literature Reviews and Paper Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides practical examples of using AI tools for academic research workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning goals\n",
    "- Understand what an API is and how to call it from Python\n",
    "- Learn to design and customize prompt templates for repeatable tasks\n",
    "- Use simple `for` loops to automate common research workflows\n",
    "- Structure outputs (JSON) so they are easy to store, filter, and analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you’ll build\n",
    "- A single-paper analyzer that extracts key fields into JSON\n",
    "- A batch processor that loops over many papers with a progress bar\n",
    "- A relevance rater that scores papers against your research question\n",
    "- A short literature synthesis generated from multiple items\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use this notebook\n",
    "- Run cells top-to-bottom the first time\n",
    "- Edit prompts in the `Prompt templates` section; re-run only the cells that depend on them\n",
    "- Use the `Loop patterns` section to demonstrate how iteration works step by step"

    "- **What is an API?** A way for your code to \"ask\" another service (like an AI model) to do something and return a result — like ordering from a menu and the kitchen delivers the dish.\n",
    "- **Why use it here?** We send a text prompt to an AI model and get a text response back.\n",
    "- **What do you need?**\n",
    "  - An account/key to prove who you are \n",
    "  - A small bit of setup to let Python talk to the service\n",
    "- **Costs/tokens:** Models bill per token (roughly word pieces). We'll show how to estimate and keep requests efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How a request works (mental model)\n",
    "1) You prepare a prompt (your instructions)\n",
    "2) Your code sends it to the API endpoint\n",
    "3) The service runs the model and returns a response\n",
    "4) You parse the response and use it (print, save, analyze)\n",

    "```\n",

    "### What “messages” mean here\n",
    "- We send both a short \"system\" message (role/context) and a \"user\" message (your prompt)\n",

      "A systematic literature review typically involves the following key components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Research question or objective: Clearly defining the research question or objective that the review aims to address is essential. This helps guide the search strategy and selection criteria for including studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Search strategy: Developing a comprehensive search strategy to identify relevant studies is crucial. This involves identifying relevant databases, keywords, and search terms to ensure a thorough and systematic search.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Study selection criteria: Establishing specific criteria for selecting studies to be included in the review helps ensure that the review is systematic and focused. These criteria may include factors such as publication date, study design, population characteristics, and outcome measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Data extraction: Systematically extracting relevant data from the selected studies is a key component of a systematic literature review. This typically involves creating a data extraction form to record key information from each study, such as study design, sample size, findings, and conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Quality assessment: Evaluating the quality of the included studies is important to assess the strength of the evidence and potential biases. Various tools and guidelines are available for assessing the quality of different types of studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Data synthesis and analysis: Synthesizing the findings from the included studies involves analyzing and summarizing the data to identify patterns, trends, and gaps in the literature. Different methods of data synthesis, such as meta-analysis or narrative synthesis, may be used depending on the nature of the studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Reporting: Clearly documenting the methods, findings, and conclusions of the systematic literature review is essential for transparency and reproducibility. Following established reporting guidelines, such as PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), can help ensure that the review is conducted and reported in a rigorous and transparent manner.\n"
